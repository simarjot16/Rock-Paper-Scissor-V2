# Rock-Paper-Scissor-V2
This is the version updation for the earlier rps game that has been added on my repos list. It has certain new features like we can store our login details in it. 

Future Modifications: If you intent to use the code this is the list of modifications that can be done -> One may keep the whole code inside a loop cell and do it repeadetly for n nuimbers of time which is defined by the user. -> One may add a gui using tkinter or pyQt libraries

Best of luck coding!!
